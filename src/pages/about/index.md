Start a newsletter business using Gatsby and Netlify today. This project comes equipped with a Netlify CMS so you can upload content quickly and easily. First set up your Netlify account. Then, head over to **[DEPLOYMENT_URL]/admin** to access your CMS and add some awesome content. 

The project was originally based on https://github.com/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms.
